    <p>Very filling and even a little zesty, this butternut squash soup is a decadent appetizer. Butternut squash is hearty on its own, but the coconut milk makes the mixture truly rich. Serve with a warm baguette.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Butternut Squash</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pumpkin Pie Spice</li>
        <li>Cayenne Pepper</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>yellow onion</li>
        <li>yellow curry powder</li>
        <li>coconut milk</li>
        <li>veggie stock</li>
        <li>nutmeg</li>
        <li>pumpkin seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place butternut squash in a baking dish, flesh side up. Brush 1 tablespoon melted butter over the flesh and top with 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, and cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour. Remove squash from oven and cool for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place a large stockpot over medium heat; add 1 tablespoon butter. Cook and stir onion in the melted butter for 2 minutes. Add curry powder; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in coconut milk; bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Scoop flesh from the butternut squash and add to coconut milk mixture; mix in remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, vegetable stock, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until soup is heated through.</li>
        <li>Blend soup using an immersion blender on low speed. Simmer until soup is smooth and thickened, about 20 minutes more. Add more vegetable stock for a thinner consistency and season with salt.</li>
        <li>Ladle soup into bowls and top each with pumpkin seeds and a pinch of nutmeg.</li>
    </ol>
